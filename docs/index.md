# Why iniWM?

`iniWM` is designed to be a fast and lightweight window manager that prioritizes simplicity in configuration. Unlike many tiling WMs that require complex scripting or configuration languages, `iniWM` uses the straightforward INI format, making it easy to understand and customize.

Inspired by the classic master-stack layout(most known in dwm,qtile), it provides a focused workspace with one primary window and a stack for secondary ones, while also offering Monocle, Floating, and Grid layouts for flexibility.
